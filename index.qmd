Hello, and welcome to my science portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, skills, and experiences in the field of science. I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## About Me

Originally from **Ghana**, I moved to Moscow, ID in Spring 2024 to study [**Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/bcb) in the [**University of Idaho**](https://www.uidaho.edu/). My first and second degrees were in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics respectively, all in the [University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani, Ghana](https://www.uenr.edu.gh/), where I also taught as an [Assistant Lecturer](https://uenr.edu.gh/staff/mr-kessie-justice-amenyo/) in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.

My research focus is in **transmissible vaccines and infectious disease modelling**, and I belong to the Laboratory for Ecological, Epidemiological, and Evolutionary Forecasting ([**LE3F**](https://www.leeef.org/)).Â 

Currently, I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that allow for viral coexistence, especially with the activation of immune response, NK-cells- and how that influences these dynamics. The aim of the research is to contribute to innovative strategies for controlling persistent viral infections and to improve vaccine designs. By leveraging on mathematical models as digital twins, I'm exploring the critical factors that can lead to more effective and long-lasting disease prevention.
