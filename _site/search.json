    "text": "About Me\nOriginally from Ghana, I moved to Moscow, ID in Spring 2024 to study Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the University of Idaho. My first and second degrees were in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics respectively, all in the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani, Ghana, where I also taught as an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\nMy research focus is in transmissible vaccines and infectious disease modelling, and I belong to the Laboratory for Ecological, Epidemiological, and Evolutionary Forecasting (LE3F).¬†\nCurrently, I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that allow for viral coexistence, especially with the activation of immune response, NK-cells- and how that influences these dynamics. The aim of the research is to contribute to innovative strategies for controlling persistent viral infections and to improve vaccine designs. By leveraging on mathematical models as digital twins, I‚Äôm exploring the critical factors that can lead to more effective and long-lasting disease prevention."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes the basic createElement() shiv technique, along with monkeypatches for document.createElement and document.createDocumentFragment for IE6-8. It also applies basic styling for HTML5 elements for IE6-9, Safari 4.x and FF 3.x.\n\n####html5shiv-printshiv.js * This includes all of the above, as well as a mechanism allowing HTML5 elements to be styled and contain children while being printed in IE 6-8.\n\n\n\n\nHTML5 Shiv is maintained by Alexander Farkas, Jonathan Neal and Paul Irish, with many contributions from John-David Dalton. It is also distributed with Modernizr.\nIf you have any issues in these implementations, you can report them here! :)\nFor the full story of HTML5 Shiv and all of the people involved in making it, read The Story of the HTML5 Shiv.\n\n\n\n###Using Bower\nbower install html5shiv --save-dev\nThis will clone the latest version of the HTML5 shiv into the bower_components directory at the root of your project and also create or update the file bower.json which specifies your projects dependencies.\nInclude the HTML5 shiv in the &lt;head&gt; of your page in a conditional comment and after any stylesheets.\n&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"bower_components/html5shiv/dist/html5shiv.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n###Manual installation\nDownload and extract the latest zip package from this repositiory and copy the two files dist/html5shiv.js and dist/html5shiv-printshiv.js into your project. Then include one of them into your &lt;head&gt; as above.\n\n\n\nHTML5 Shiv works as a simple drop-in solution. In most cases there is no need to configure HTML5 Shiv or use methods provided by HTML5 Shiv.\n\n\nThe elements option is a space separated string or array, which describes the full list of the elements to shiv. see also addElements.\nConfiguring elements before html5shiv.js is included.\n//create a global html5 options object\nwindow.html5 = {\n  'elements': 'mark section customelement' \n};\nConfiguring elements after html5shiv.js is included.\n//change the html5shiv options object \nwindow.html5.elements = 'mark section customelement';\n//and re-invoke the `shivDocument` method\nhtml5.shivDocument(document);\n\n\n\nIf shivCSS is set to true HTML5 Shiv will add basic styles (mostly display: block) to sectioning elements (like section, article). In most cases a webpage author should include those basic styles in his normal stylesheet to ensure older browser support (i.e.¬†Firefox 3.6) without JavaScript.\nThe shivCSS is true by default and can be set false, only before html5shiv.js is included:\n//create a global html5 options object\nwindow.html5 = {\n    'shivCSS': false\n};\n\n\n\nIf the shivMethods option is set to true (by default) HTML5 Shiv will override document.createElement/document.createDocumentFragment in Internet Explorer 6-8 to allow dynamic DOM creation of HTML5 elements.\nKnown issue: If an element is created using the overridden createElement method this element returns a document fragment as its parentNode, but should be normally null. If a script relies on this behavior, shivMethodsshould be set to false. Note: jQuery 1.7+ has implemented his own HTML5 DOM creation fix for Internet Explorer 6-8. If all your scripts (including Third party scripts) are using jQuery‚Äôs manipulation and DOM creation methods, you might want to set this option to false.\nConfiguring shivMethods before html5shiv.js is included.\n//create a global html5 options object\nwindow.html5 = {\n    'shivMethods': false\n};\nConfiguring elements after html5shiv.js is included.\n//change the html5shiv options object \nwindow.html5.shivMethods = false;\n\n\n\nThe html5.addElements method extends the list of elements to shiv. The newElements argument can be a whitespace separated list or an array.\n//extend list of elements to shiv\nhtml5.addElements('element content');\n\n\n\nThe html5.createElement method creates a shived element, even if shivMethods is set to false.\nvar container = html5.createElement('div');\n//container is shived so we can add HTML5 elements using `innerHTML`\ncontainer.innerHTML = '&lt;section&gt;This is a section&lt;/section&gt;';\n\n\n\nThe html5.createDocumentFragment method creates a shived document fragment, even if shivMethods is set to false.\nvar fragment = html5.createDocumentFragment();\nvar container = document.createElement('div');\nfragment.appendChild(container);\n//fragment is shived so we can add HTML5 elements using `innerHTML`\ncontainer.innerHTML = '&lt;section&gt;This is a section&lt;/section&gt;';\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shivMethods option (overriding document.createElement) and the html5.createElement method create elements, which are not disconnected and have a parentNode (see also issue #64)\nThe cloneNode problem is currently not addressed by HTML5 Shiv. HTML5 elements can be dynamically created, but can‚Äôt be cloned in all cases.\nThe printshiv version of HTML5 Shiv has to alter the print styles and the whole DOM for printing. In case of complex websites and or a lot of print styles this might cause performance and/or styling issues. A possible solution could be the htc-branch of HTML5 Shiv, which uses another technique to implement print styles for Internet Explorer 6-8.\n\n\n\n\nThe original conception and community collaboration story of the project is described at The History of the HTML5 Shiv.\nIEPP, by Jon Neal, addressed the printing fault of the original html5shiv. It was merged into html5shiv.\nShimprove, in April 2010, patched cloneNode and createElement was later merged into html5shiv\ninnerShiv, introduced in August 2010 by JD Barlett, addressed dynamically adding new HTML5 elements into the DOM. jQuery added support that made innerShiv redundant and html5shiv addressed the same issues as well, so the project was completed.\nThe html5shim and html5shiv sites on Google Code are maintained by Remy Sharp and are identical distribution points of this html5shiv project.\nModernizr is developed by the same people as html5shiv and can include the latest version in any custom builds created at modernizr.com\nThis html5shiv repo now contains tests for all the edge cases pursued by the above libraries and has been extensively tested, both in development and production.\n\nA detailed changelog of html5shiv is available.\n\n\n\nThe term shiv originates from John Resig, who was thought to have used the word for its slang meaning, a sharp object used as a knife-like weapon, intended for Internet Explorer. Truth be known, John probably intended to use the word shim, which in computing means an application compatibility workaround. Rather than correct his mispelling, most developers familiar with Internet Explorer appreciated the visual imagery. And that, kids, is etymology."

No changes were needed, but we did upgrade the included jQuery file to the latest release.\nMoved changelog to be within the repo instead of as a wiki page.\n\nNew and improved features:\n\nAdded carousel indicators! Add the HTML and it automagically works.\nAdded container option to tooltips. The default option is still insertAfter, but now you may specify where to insert tooltips (and by extension, popovers) with the optional container parameter.\nImproved popovers now utilize max-width instead of width, have been widened from 240px to 280px, and will automatically hide the title if one has not been set via CSS :empty selector.\nImproved tooltip alignment on edges with #6713.\nImproved accessibility for links in all components. After merging #6441, link hover states now apply to the :focus state as well. This goes for basic &lt;a&gt; tags, as well as buttons, navs, dropdowns, and more.\nAdded print utility classes to show and hide content between screen and print via CSS.\nUpdated input groups to make them behave more like default form controls. Added display: inline-block;, increased margin-bottom, and added vertical-align: middle; to match &lt;input&gt; styles.\nAdded .horizontal-three-colors() gradient mixin (with example in the CSS tests file).\nAdded .text-left, .text-center, and .text-right utility classes for easy typographic alignment.\nAdded @ms-viewport so IE10 can use responsive CSS when in split-screen mode.\n\nDocs changes:\n\nAdded new justified navigation example.\nAdded sticky footer with fixed navbar example.\n\n\nSee more on the 2.3.0 pull request."

Instead of a generic input selector and various resets, we target each type of input like input[type=\"text\"], input[type=\"password\"], etc.\nForm field state (e.g., success or error) now applies to checkbox and radio labels.\nRemoved redundant CSS on &lt;p&gt; for font-family, font-size, and line-height.\nRemoved redundant color declaration from the &lt;label&gt; element.\nAdded variables for dropdown dividers border colors.\nlegend and .form-actions share the same border-color, #e5e5e5.\nFixed some responsive issues with input-prepend and -append, notably with the fluid grid.\nAdded special CSS to prevent max-width: 100%; on images from messing up Google Maps rendering.\nScope opened dropdowns to only immediate children to avoid unintended cascade.\nSimilarly, scope floated-right dropdowns to immediate children with .pull-right &gt; .dropdown-menu.\nUpdated .placeholder() mixin to use & operator in Less for proper output when compiling.\nAdded -ms-input-placeholder to .placeholder() mixin.\nAdded CSS3 hyphens mixin.\nFixed a bug in IE7/8 where certain form controls would not show text if the parent had a filter opacity set."

    "text": "2.0.3 (April 24, 2012)\nRunning makefile now require JSHint and Recess.\n\nHTML and CSS\n\nOverhauled the responsive utility classes to simplify required CSS, add !important to all declarations, and use display: inherit in place of display: block to account for different types of elements.\nRemoved &gt; from fluid grid column selectors, meaning every element with a .span* class within a .row-fluid will use percentage widths instead of fixed-pixels.\nFixed regression in responsive images support as of 2.0.1. We‚Äôve re-added max-width: 100%; to images by default. We removed it in our last release since we had folks complaining about Google Maps integration and other projects, but we‚Äôre taking a different stance now on these things and will require developers to make these tweaks on their end.\nAdded variable @navbarBrandColor for the brand element in navbars, which defaults to @navbarLinkColor.\nFont-family mixins now use variables for their stacks.\nFixed an unescaped filter on the .reset-filter() mixin that was causing some errors depending on your compiler.\nFixed regression in .form-actions background, which was too dark, by adding a new variable @formActionsBackground and changing the color to #f5f5f5 instead of #eee.\nFixed an issue on button group dropdowns where the background color was not using the button‚Äôs darker color when the dropdown is open.\nGeneralized and simplified the open dropdown classes while adding smarter defaults. Instead of .dropdown.open, we now use just .open. On the defaults side, all dropdown menus now have rounded corners to start.\nImproved active .dropdown-toggle styles (for dropdown buttons) by darkening the background and sharpening the inset shadow to match the active state of buttons.\nDirection of animation on progress bars reversed.\nFixed input-prepend/append issue with uneditable inputs: .uneditable-input was being floated and a missing comma meant its border-radius for the append option wasn‚Äôt being applied properly.\nRemoved height: auto; from img since it was overriding dimensions set via HTML attributes.\nFixed an issue of double borders on the top of tables with captions or colgroups.\nFixed issue with anchor buttons in the .navbar-text. Instead of a general styling on all anchors within an element with that class, we now have a new class to specifically apply appropriate link color.\nAdded support for @navbarHeight on the brand/project name and nav links for complete navbar height customization.\nFixed the black borders on buttons problem in IE7 by removing the border, increasing the line-height, and providing darker background colors.\nRemoved excess padding on .search-query inputs in IE7 since it doesn‚Äôt have border-radius.\nUpdated alert messages in Components to use button elements as close icons instead of a. Both can be used, but an a will require href=\"#\" for dismissal on iOS devices.\nFixed an issue with prepended/appended inputs in Firefox where select elements required two clicks to toggle the dropdown. Resolved by moving the position: relative to the select by default instead of on :focus.\nAdded a new mixin, .backface-visibility, to help refine CSS 3D tranforms. Examples and explanation of usage can be found on CSS Tricks.\nChanged specificity of grid classes in responsive layouts under 767px to accurately target input, select, and textarea elements that use .span* classes.\nHorizontal description lists, .dl-horizontal, now truncate terms that are too long to fit in their fixed-width column. In the &lt; 767px responsive layout, they change to their default stacked layout.\nChanged tabbable tabs to prevent issues in left and right aligned tabs. .tab-content would not growing to its parent‚Äôs full width due to display: table. We removed that and the width: 100% and instead just set overflow: auto to clear the left and right aligned tabs.\nUpdated thumbnails to support fluid grid column sizing.\nAdded &gt; to most of the button group selectors\nAdded new variable, @inputBorderRadius, to all form controls that previously made use of the static 3px value everywhere.\nChanged the way we do border-radius for tables. Instead of the regular mixin that zeros out all other corners, we specify one corner only so they can be combined for use on single column table headers.\nUpdated Glyphicons Halflings from 1.5 to 1.6, introducing 20 new icons.\nAdded an offset paramater to the .makeColumn.\nIncreased the specificity of all tabbable nav selectors to include .nav-collapse to appropriately scope the responsive navbar behavior.\nFixed uneditable inputs: text now cuts off and does not wrap, making it behave just like a default input.\nLabels and badges are now vertical-align: baseline; so they line up with surrounding text.\n\n\n\nJavascript\n\nAdd jshint support\nAdd travis-ci support w/ headless phantom integration\nReplace UA sniffing in bootstrap-transitions.js\nAdd MSTransitionEnd event to transition plugin\nFix pause method in carousel (shouldn‚Äôt restart when hovering over controls)\nFix crazy opera bug #1776\nDon‚Äôt open dropdown if target element is disabled\nAlways select last item in scrollspy if you‚Äôve reached the bottom of the document or element\nTypeahead should escape regexp special chars\nIf interval is false on carousel, do not auto-cycle\nAdd preventDefault support for all initial event types (show, close, hide, etc.)\nFix collapse bug in ie7+ for initial collapse in\nFix nested collapse bug\nIf transitioning collapse, don‚Äôt start new transition\nTry to autodetect when to use html/text method in tooltip/popovers to help prevent xss\nAdd bootstrap + bootstrap.min.js to gh-pages for @remy and jsbin support\n\n\n\nDocumentation and repo\n\nCombined badges and labels into a single LESS file, labels-badges.less, to reduce repeated CSS.\nSeparated responsive features into multiple files. We now have a file for each grouping of media queries (tablets and down, tablets to desktops, and large desktops). Additionally, the visible/hidden utility classes and the responsive navbar are in their own files. The output is the same in the compiled CSS, but this should give folks a bit more flexibility.\nAdded a new CSS Tests page in the docs (not in the top nav) for better testing of edge cases and extending the use of standard components.\nRemoved the bootstrap.zip file from the repo and the make process for faster building and a lighter repo. From now on, the zip will only be in the documentation branch.\nFixed incorrect use of class instead of ID for tabs example and added documentation for multiple ways of toggling tabs.\nFixed required markup listed for the specialized navbar search field.\nRemoved all mention of @siteWidth, a variable no longer in use.\nRemoved mentions of unused @buttonPrimaryBackground variable, which is no longer in use.\nUpdated LESS docs page to include all the new variables we added in previous releases.\nRemoved broken ‚Äúdropup‚Äù menus from tabs and pills examples (shouldn‚Äôt have been there in the first place).\nReplaced .badge-error with .badge-important. The error option is not a valid class and was a typo in the docs.\nFixed mention of how to add plain text to the navbar. Previously the docs stated you only needed a p tag, but the required HTML is any element with class .navbar-text.\nClarified the use of .tabbable for tabs. The wrapping class is only required for left and right tabs to clear their floats. Also added mention of .fade to fade in tabs.\nUpdated forms documentation:\n\nRemove unnecessary duplicate help text in first example\nAdded mention of required input class, .search-query, for the search form variation\nRemoved incorrect mention of form fields being display: block; to start as fields are inline-block to start.\n\nAdded mention of data-target attribute for the dropdowns javascript plugin to show how to keep custom URLs intact on links with .dropdown-toggle class.\nUpdated the Kippt screenshot on the homepage to reflect their recent responsive redesign and upgrade to 2.0.2."

This was changed to allow the use of .pull-left and .pull-right to align buttons easily.

    "text": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n            Preamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software‚Äìto make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation‚Äôs software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author‚Äôs protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors‚Äô reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone‚Äôs free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The ‚ÄúProgram‚Äù, below, refers to any such program or work, and a ‚Äúwork based on the Program‚Äù means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ‚Äúmodification‚Äù.) Each licensee is addressed as ‚Äúyou‚Äù.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program‚Äôs source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients‚Äô exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ‚Äúany later version‚Äù, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
